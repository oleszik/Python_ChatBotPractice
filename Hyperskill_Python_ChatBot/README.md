# Python ChatBot Practice (Original Version)

A simple beginner chatbot written in Python.  
This is the **original/basic version** before upgrades.

## What It Does

- Greets the user with a fixed bot name and birth year (`Aid`, `2023`)
- Asks for the user’s name and responds with a compliment
- Guesses the user’s age using remainders when dividing by `3`, `5`, and `7`
- Counts from `0` to a number entered by the user
- Asks one programming quiz question and repeats until the correct answer is given
- Ends with a goodbye message

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

## Run

```powershell
python ChatBot.py
